# ðŸŽ¨ Anupamâ€™s Art Space

Hi, Iâ€™m Anupam Bera â€” an artist at heart and a developer by passion.
From sketching with a simple pencil to experimenting with digital tools, I love bringing imagination to life through pencil, digital, watercolor, oil, and acrylic paintings. Every stroke I make is not just about colors and shapes, but about telling a story, capturing an emotion, and freezing a moment forever.

Alongside my love for art, Iâ€™m also a passionate developer. Creativity doesnâ€™t just flow in my paintings â€” it also guides the way I design and build meaningful digital experiences. Whether itâ€™s coding or painting, my aim is the same: to create something unique, thoughtful, and impactful.

This gallery is a reflection of my journey â€” where art meets technology, and where every piece carries a little part of me. I hope as you explore my works, youâ€™ll find inspiration, connection, and maybe even a piece that speaks to your own story.

A simple yet professional **Art Gallery Website** Where Every Canvas Speaks a Thousand Words!, built with **PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap 5, and FontAwesome**.  
It allows you (Admin) to manage artworks, about info, and contact details, while users can explore the gallery, sign up, and interact.


## Quick Start

1. Create a MySQL database and user, or run the schema:
   - Import `schema.sql` into MySQL (it creates `art_gallery` DB and tables and seeds a default admin).
   - Default Admin: **admin@example.com / admin123**

2. Configure DB credentials:
   - Edit `config.php` with your MySQL host, username, password.

3. Run with XAMPP/WAMP:
   - Copy the whole `art_gallery` folder into your server root:
     - XAMPP: `C:/xampp/htdocs/`
     - WAMP:  `C:/wamp64/www/`
   - Visit: `http://localhost/art_gallery/`

4. File/Folder Permissions:
   - Ensure `uploads/` is writable by the web server (for image uploads).
